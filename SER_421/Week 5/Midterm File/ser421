????  VI. HTTP (10 points)
????  a) (2) HTTP can be connection-oriented or connectionless. What physical computing resource do these terms describe?

	A socket. Application Layer. 




????  b) (2) Who requests a persistent connection, and who decides whether the connection is persistent? (the client [browser] 
????  or the web server)

	The client requests a persistent connection. The server decides if it can keep the connection persistent. 




????  c) (2) Which level of HTTP response codes (1xx, 2xx, 3x, 4xx, or 5xx) indicates the client (browser) sent an improper 
????  request of some kind??
	
	4xx



????  VII. HTML (6 points). There were 2 factions that tried to evolve HTML in 2 directions. #1: one direction was to create a 
????  structured and more semantically meaningful representation format, and #2 the other supported a more forgiving syntax.

????  i)      (2) Which group won out (#1 or #2 above) 
		
		#2

????  ii)     (2) Why did they win out?

		
		Because it was error-forgiving. 



????  iii)    (2) Even though one group lost, how did it influence the HTML5 we see today?
		
		More structured syntax. Updates to Forms. New Object types. Updates to existing tags.  


		


????  VIII. Stateful coding on the web (13 points)
????  a) (5) We discussed various types of state and mechanisms for implementing those forms of state. On the left are types of 
????  state we discussed. On the right are implementation technologies. In the blank on the left put ALL of the letters of 
????  technologies suitable for implementing that form of state. Use each implementation letter EXACTLY ONCE.



????  ________A____________World model state                  A. Flat file system
????                                                          B. URL Rewriting
????  ________D,E,B________ Conversational state              C. Cookies
????                                                          D. Express Sessions
????  ________C____________ User profile state                E. Hidden form fields


????  b)(4) Now pick any of the terms on the right you used for conversational state, and give i) a benefit, ii) and a drawback

	URL Rewriting: 
	
	i) benefit: portable 
	
	ii)drawback: possibly not secure, all URL’s need to be modified. 



????  c)(4) Web application architectures generally store conversational state on the server-side nowadays. Describe one 
????  benefit of this design decision, and also describe one possible drawback.

	One benefit is that it can be encrypted, and there is a key exchange as part of the process. 

	One drawback is that user experience suffers, and it’s computationally more expensive. 


????  IX. Node/Express (22 points). For this question use the figure at http://swent1linux.asu.edu:8081/Q9.png

????  a) (6) Consider the figure. Which of the requests, R1, R2, R3, or R4, shows the best computational profile in 
????  NodeJS? Explain WHY it is the best?

	R2 is the best computational profile. Because the request is making short non-blocking calls. In other words it’s processing 
       tasks quickly and returning to the event queue to process the next request. By looking at the figure the time it takes to handle   requests is the fastest.  




????  b) (6) Which one shows the worst computational profile. Explain WHY it is the worst. 
	
	R4 is the worst computational profile. This profile seems like it’s taking a longer time to process a task. It’s blocking for a    longer period of time then any of the other profiles. 




????  c) (4) For each term below indicate whether it pertains to the M the V or the C part of the MVC pattern in the context 
????  of the NodeJS + Express technology stack. Leave it blank if it has nothing to do with MVC. 


????  ____C_____ routing (app.get/post/all)         ____V_____ Jade             ___V______ EJS                   ____M_____ fs


 
????  d) (6) We have discussed the concept of impedance mismatch in several ways so far in this course. HTTP is synchronous 
????  yet NodeJS is asynchronous - does this cause an impedance mismatch problem? Why or why not?

	Node recognizes the possibility of impedance mismatch that can be caused from asynchronous and synchronous (or blocking I/O) processes. So instead it issues a callback functions that executes when a certain processes need to block, and then executes the callback when the process is free again. This
